# Prevalence of Rare Disease
## Overview
#### Orphanet systematically surveys literature to estimate the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases, updating data biannually. Reports list diseases alphabetically or by decreasing prevalence/incidence. 

## Methedology
#### Data is gathered from registries, health institutes (e.g., WHO, CDC), Medline searches, medical texts, grey literature, and expert reports. The data are either worldwide or European estimations, raw or extrapolated. 
#### Prevalence for congenital diseases is calculated using birth prevalence and life expectancy, while incidence data is used to estimate prevalence when necessary. 
#### Limitations include potential overestimation and interchangeable use of terms in sources. The report covers a selection of Orphanet's data on 6,089 rare diseases; complete data is available on Orphadata.
